INTEGRATED PERFORMANCE MONITORING REPORT
==================================================

STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION ACHIEVEMENTS:
• Import Performance: 33.2% improvement
  (1.506s → 1.006s)
• Complexity Reduction: 82.0% improvement
• Memory Efficiency: 20.0% improvement
• Startup Overhead: 93.9% reduction

RUNTIME PERFORMANCE METRICS:
• Chi-squared batch calculation: 0.009ms
• Current import time: 1.006s

REGRESSION DETECTION:
⚠️  1 regressions detected:
  - Import time regression detected: 1.006s vs 0.092s baseline (993.5% slower)

OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider further lazy loading optimization - import time could be reduced
2. Maintain current lazy loading architecture to preserve import performance gains
3. Continue monitoring cyclomatic complexity to prevent regression from 8+ complexity
4. Regularly audit for new unused imports and dead code accumulation
5. Consider implementing automatic performance regression testing in CI/CD
